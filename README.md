# Betterfox 140 ESR
These prefs are applicable for [Firefox ESR 140.0](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/switch-to-firefox-extended-support-release-esr). <sup>[^more info](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-esr-release-cycle)</sup>

Using regular Firefox? [Switch back to the main branch](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox).

## Required reading

1) Download the user.js file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/esr140/user.js) (Right click > `Save Link Asâ€¦`).
2) Review both [Common Overrides](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Common-Overrides) and [Optional Hardening](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Optional-Hardening) to make any necessary changes.
3) Open Firefox. In the URL bar, type `about:profiles` and press **Enter**.
4) For the profile you want to use, click **Open Folder** in the **Root Directory** section.
5) Move the `user.js` file into the folder.

*After restarting Firefox:*
1) Get an **ad blocker** like [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/blog/ublock-origin-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ad-blocker/) with our [recommended filters](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists#guidelines).
2) Enable **DNS-level protection** with your chosen [provider](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Optional-Hardening#secure-dns) to further protect against security threats, ads, and trackers.
